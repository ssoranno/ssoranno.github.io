Hello, my name is Steven Soranno and I am a CNAPP Solutions Engineer at Fortinet with a background in Cloud Security Engineering.  I spent the first 5 years of my career at KPMG as a Security Consultant Specializing in Cloud Security Engineering before transitioning to Lacework which was eventually acquired by Fortinet.  I hold multiple technical SANs certifications (GCSA, GCPN) and I have a bachelors in Computer Engineering.

Outside of work I enjoy golfing, snowboarding, and volunteering at the occasional security conference (shoutout to [bsidesNYC](https://bsidesnyc.org/)).

I created this blog as a place to document my thoughts and research on the cloud security, the cybersecurity industry, and life in general.  If you like what I write, feel free to reach out to me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssoranno/).
